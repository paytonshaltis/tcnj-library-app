  <h1>Incorrect Study Room Data?</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>How We Collect Data</h2>
  <p>
    The TCNJ Library App reports study room occupancy data based on the readings of motion sensors
    in each room. Inconsistencies between the app and the TCNJ Library are likely due to the sensitivity
    of these sensors.
  </p>
  <h2>False Positives</h2>
  <p>
    If students remain very still in a study room, it is possible that the motion sensors will indicate
    that a room is <em>unoccupied</em>, even if there truly are students in the room. Once motion is detected
    again, the app will begin displaying accurate data.
  </p>
  <h2>False Negatives</h2>
  <p>
    If students pass by a sensitive motion sensor, the app may indicate that the room is <em>occupied</em>, even
    if there are no students in the room. After some time, the motion sensor will fail to detect motion and 
    the app will begin displaying accurate data.
