  <h1>Incorrect Study Room Data?</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>How We Collect Data</h2>
  <p>
    The TCNJ Library App reports study room occupancy data based on the readings of motion sensors
    in each room.
  </p>
  <h2>False Positives</h2>
  <p>
    If students remain very still in a study room, it is possible that the motion sensors will indicate
    that a room is <em>unoccupied</em>, even if there truly are students in the room.
  </p>
  <h2>False Negatives</h2>
  <p>
    If students pass by a sensitive motion sensor, the app may indicate that the room is <em>occupied</em>, even
    if there are no students in the room.
  </p>
  <h2>Other Errors?</h2>
  <p>
    If you do happen to notice something else that you believe to be an error with the TCNJ Library App, please 
    feel free to let us know!
