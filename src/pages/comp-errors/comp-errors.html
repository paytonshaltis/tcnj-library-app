  <h1>Incorrect Computer Data?</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>How We Collect Data</h2>
  <p>
    The TCNJ Library App reports computer occupancy data based on which computers are currently logged in
    at the time.
  </p>
  <h2>False Positives</h2>
  <p>
    If students are sitting at a computer but have not logged in, the app will indicate that this computer is 
    <em>unoccupied</em>, even if there is a student at the computer.
  </p>
  <h2>False Negatives</h2>
  <p>
    If students fail to sign out of a computer, the app will indicate that this computer is <em>occupied</em>,
    even though there is no student actively using the machine.
  </p>
  <h2>Other Errors?</h2>
  <p>
    If you do happen to notice something else that you believe to be an error with the TCNJ Library App, please 
    feel free to let us know!
