  <h1>Incorrect Computer Data?</h1>

  <h2>How We Collect Data</h2>
  <p>
    The TCNJ Library App reports computer occupancy data based on which computers are currently logged in
    at the time. Inconsistencies between the app and the TCNJ Library are likely due to students failing to
    sign into or out of computers.
  </p>
  <h2>False Positives</h2>
  <p>
    If students are sitting at a computer but have not logged in, the app will indicate that this computer is 
    <em>unoccupied</em>, even if there is a student at the computer. We encourage students to sit elsewhere if 
    they are not using the computers so that other students may use them.
  </p>
  <h2>False Negatives</h2>
  <p>
    If students fail to sign out of a computer, the app will indicate that this computer is <em>occupied</em>,
    even though there is no student actively using the machine. We encourage students to sign out of computers 
    when they are done using them in order to keep occupancy data as accurate as possible.
