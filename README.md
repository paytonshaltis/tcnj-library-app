# TCNJ Library App
TCNJ's official Library App. Includes real-time study room and computer occupancy data. Created and updated by students in Dr. Knox's CS research lab as part of a capstone experience. This repository represents the state of the project after my contributions.

To see contributions to the Mac Occupancy module of the application, check out [this repository](https://github.com/paytonshaltis/mac-occupancy).
